    It's likely that ToolSeparator is the tallest item in the
    StatusBar. If all separators were completely hidden (and not laid
    out), the size of the status bar would jump around when the various
    items are shown/hidden. Initially we were solving this by always
    showing the first separator, but setting its opacity to 0 if it
    wouldn't be shown. This works, but requires that every separator to
    the right of it keep track of the visibility of the ones before it
    (so that we didn't end up with two separators next to each other).

    Another solution would be to give an item that's always visible
    (like pointerIconLabel) a minimumHeight that matches the height
    of ToolSeparator, but that would have to be done for each style,
    and isn't that nice.

    So, to avoid having to hard-code sizes and have complex visible
    bindings, we do the opacity trick for each separator, and also
    reduce its width to 0 so it doesn't take up any room.
