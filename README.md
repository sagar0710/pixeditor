# Slate Tileset Editor

A simple bitmap editor for 2D tilesets, written with [Qt Quick Controls 2](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquickcontrols2-index.html).

Slate's goal is to simplify the creation of seamless tilesets.

### Notes: ###
- This is a work in progress, but should already be usable. Feel free to report any bugs you find. :)
- The UI is currently designed for the [Material style](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquickcontrols2-material.html), and will probably look bad when run with others.
- Windows Binaries are coming soon. Other platforms (Linux, Mac) will follow once I've tested on them.

### Dependencies ###

* Qt >= 5.8
* https://github.com/mitchcurtis/qt-undo
* https://github.com/mitchcurtis/pickawinner
