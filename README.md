# Slate - Pixel Art Editor

Slate is a bitmap editor available for Linux, Windows and Mac. With Slate, you can:

- Edit images directly
- Use layers
- Create seamless 2D tilesets
- Preview sprite sheet animations

Slate was built for pixel art, and its goal is to simplify the creation of sprites and tilesets by offering a user-friendly, customisable interface.

### Downloads ###

See the [releases](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/releases) page for the available downloads.

### Documentation ###
- [Overview](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/blob/master/doc/overview.md)

### Notes ###
- This is a work in progress, but should already be usable. Feel free to report any bugs you find. :)
- If you are unable to run the app on Windows, you may need to install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). If that link breaks, [this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) or [this](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) should work (choose the x64 version). This will be installed automatically when I get around to [making a proper installer](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/issues/42).
- The UI is currently designed for the [Material style](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquickcontrols2-material.html), and will probably look bad when run with others.

## Building From Source ##

### Dependencies ###

* Qt >= 5.11
* https://github.com/mitchcurtis/qt-undo (submodule; see [Building](#building))

### Cloning ###

`master` is the default branch where all work is done, and is not guaranteed to be stable. I [tag](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/tags) releases, so if you're looking for a stable build to try out, it's best to pick the latest one from `git tag -l`. 

### Building ###

qt-undo can be cloned and built separately, but it is also available as a submodule of Slate's repo, and can therefore be built automatically when Slate is built, by first running the following commands:

    cd /path/to/slate-source-dir
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    
Once that's set up, there are two options for building:

#### Qt Creator ####
Open [slate.pro](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/blob/master/slate.pro) in Qt Creator, configure the project using a kit with a Qt version that meets the requirement listed in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section, and then build it.

#### Command Line ####

In-source builds:

    cd /path/to/slate-source-dir
    /path/to/qt/qmake
    make (or nmake/jom on Windows)

Shadow builds:

    mkdir slate-build
    cd slate-build
    /path/to/qt/qmake /path/to/slate-source-dir/slate.pro
    make (or nmake/jom on Windows)
