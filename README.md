</p>

Slate is a bitmap editor available for Linux, Windows and Mac. With Slate, you can:

- Edit images directly
- Use layers
- Create seamless 2D tilesets
- Preview sprite sheet animations

Slate was built for pixel art, and its goal is to simplify the creation of sprites and tilesets by offering a user-friendly, customisable interface.

See the [releases](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/releases) page for the full list of available downloads.

Note that the Linux binaries are built on Ubuntu 18.04.3 and may not work with other distributions. If you encounter issues running Slate on Linux, try [building from source](#building-from-source).

### Installing ###

All Slate builds are portable, meaning that no installation is necessary. On Windows, however, it may be necessary to run the vc_redist.x64.exe file that comes with the download in order to install certain Microsoft C++ libraries if you've never installed any applications that require this prior to running Slate.

## Building From Source ##

### Dependencies ###

* Qt 5.15

### Cloning ###

`master` is the branch where development is done, and `release` is the stable branch where releases are made from. I also [tag](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/tags) releases.

### Building ###

Slate uses Qbs as the primary build system, with experimental CMake support added by the community. The sections below document the process of building Slate with Qbs.

#### Qt Creator ####

It's recommended to build using Qt Creator for convenience.

Open [slate.qbs](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/blob/release/slate.qbs) in Qt Creator, configure the project using a kit with a Qt version that meets the requirement listed in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section, and then build it.

#### Command Line ####

##### Qbs

First, follow Qbs' [setup guide](http://doc.qt.io/qbs/setup.html). Once you've set it up, choose one of the following approaches.

In-source builds:

    cd /path/to/slate-source-dir
    qbs

Shadow builds:

    mkdir slate-build
    cd slate-build
    qbs /path/to/slate-source-dir/slate.qbs

For more information about building Qbs applications, see [this page](http://doc.qt.io/qbs/building-applications.html).

##### CMake

In-source builds:

    cd /path/to/slate-source-dir
    cmake .
    cmake --build .

Shadow builds:

    mkdir slate-build
    cd slate-build
    cmake /path/to/slate-source-dir/slate.qbs
    cmake --build .

To run all test cases:

    cd slate-build
    ctest
