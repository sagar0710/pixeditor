# Slate - Overview

## User Interface

- [User Interface](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/blob/master/doc/user-interface.md)

## Project Types

### Images

![Image Project icon](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/blob/master/app/images/image-project.svg)

Slate supports editing bitmap images directly. This project type has no layer support.

### Layered Images

![Layered Image Project icon](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/blob/master/app/images/layered-image-project.svg)

A layered image project can contain several images, each of which is stored as a layer. The highest layer in the list is drawn on top of the layers below it. This type of project can be exported as one or more images.

### Tilesets

![Tileset Project icon](https://github.com/mitchcurtis/slate/blob/master/app/images/tileset-project.svg)

Tileset projects have a tileset bitmap image that can be edited by first painting tiles onto the grid, and then editing those tiles. An accompanying project file is created to save the contents of the grid. The tileset image is edited directly (i.e overwritten when the project is saved).
