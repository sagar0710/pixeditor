/*
    This exists for the following reasons:

    - It's for saving project-specific data: ApplicationSettings is used for application-wide settings.

    - The following will not affect a QVariant(Map) property:

      uiState.foo = "abc"
      print(uiState.foo) // undefined

      You have to create a temporary and then reassign it:

      var map = {}
      map.foo = "abc"
      uiState = map
      print(uiState.foo) // "abc"

    - There's no one-liner to get a default value from QML if a certain key
      doesn't exist in a QVariantMap, meaning you end up with stuff like this:

      contentY = uiState.foo !== undefined ? uiState.foo : 0

    - Previously we had strongly typed properties in LayeredImageProject (layerListViewContentY),
      but now that we use SplitView, we need properties in the base Project type since it applies
      to all subclasses. This class allows us to support this and future properties, which is
      not really possible with a C++ class that uses strongly typed properties:

      class Project : public QObject {
          Q_PROPERTY(ProjectUiState *uiState ...)
      }

      class LayeredImageProject : public Project {
          // I dunno if this (shadowing a base class property with a different type)
          // even works, but it's not nice either way.
          Q_PROPERTY(LayeredImageProjectUiState *uiState ...)
      }

    - Having lots of UI state properties littering the project API is not nice.

    - Both ImageCanvas and QML elements such as SplitView need to be able to save state;
      if it was just ImageCanvas, we could store the state as a QJsonObject.
